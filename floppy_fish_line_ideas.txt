Keep floundering.  You're sure to get somewhere eventually!

(paint bucket) Your argument is invalid.  This is clearly a red herring.
You've been playing for quite a while.  Could it be that you're... hooked?
It's a shame I didn't make this game back in the early 90's, because it would have been great to tell players to insert the next floppy.

Fin.
Making a successful indie game is tough, so this one is very likely to flop.
You'd think, as a fish, scaling these obstacles would be easier.
